A day in the life of HPF8N1-E09 was usually very much the same. It began in a long and narrow room with a low ceiling, sterile white walls, and large lighting panels that flickered on to signal morning. The hundreds of people contained in this room would arise from peaceful sleep, clambering out of individual bunk beds lined up in rows that stretched as far to each side as one could see — all those people wide awake, full of energy, and ready to work.

After putting on a pair of form-fitting white shorts and an orange shirt, HPF8N1-E09 would join these people walking out of the dormitory, through individual doors for every short row of bunks. From there they would start to wander through a large maze of hallways and elevators to head to their respective working locations. Each worker had the long and often convoluted path to their places of employment perfectly memorized, so no one got lost or even stumbled into each other’s way. E09 sometimes wondered why they couldn’t put his quarters closer to his factory, but he was fine taking this walk all the same. It was just another part of his morning.

Upon reaching their workplaces, people would file into the mess hall, where they were served their morning meal. Sometimes E09 didn’t have the appetite for it, but he would always consume the entire meal, assured that he would be receiving sufficient nutrition that would sustain him for many hours, after which he would return to the mess hall and be nourished again.

After finishing their morning meals, the crew would pass through the opposite side of the mess hall into various cleanrooms, where they would be washed and sterilized, to a degree dependent on their duties, and given their standard brightly-colored uniforms.

HPF8N1-E09 appreciated the regularity of his day. In fact, he enjoyed it. It gave him great satisfaction knowing that he wouldn’t waste a second doing something unnecessary, and that he could focus intently on what he was put here to do, what he was good at. Every other detail had been taken care of, every operation planned. Food, hygiene, and sleep were none of his concern. He didn’t have to worry about anything at all but his work.

As he stepped out of the cleanroom, he recognized his bunkmate, who slept above him in the dormitory. He had a similar number, as did everyone in this factory, but after the dash he was much more impressive. HPF8N1-M13.

Every worker’s number started with HPF. Their number identified their dormitory, details about their person, and their occupation. 8N1 indicated the workplace to which a person was assigned. The E in E09 meant he was a senior electrical technician. The low number 09 indicated he was one of the best. His main area of expertise was in the power grids, the conduits by which the main fusion reactor that supplied the entire operation routed energy to all the systems and machines in the factory.

The M indicated that M13 was an onsite medic, ensuring that in the event of an accident, the victim of any injury would be removed from the floor immediately and receive medical treatment. The last line of defense against machine, or human, error.

E09 smiled politely at M13, and M13 recognized him. He walked over to where E09 was pulling his regulation medical gear from his workbench in the preparation area.

“Good morning, E09,” he said. “How are you today?”

M13’s uniform was red and white, and fit tightly around his body. E09 imperceptibly bowed his head at him. It wasn’t necessary, as the medic wasn’t his superior, but his number was still higher-ranking and he generally respected medics. They’d pulled him out of a few scrapes, as he tended to work on pretty dangerous sections of the electrical system. It was simply a humble gesture. “Very good,” he replied.

“That’s great to hear,” M13 said, beaming back. “We were worried about you yesterday, from the accident.”

E09 was surprised. Accident? He couldn’t remember there being an accident. As far as he knew, he had gone through the ritual of the day just like any other. He recalled not having much to do but routine exam operations — and they had been particularly routine that day.

“I don’t remember being involved in an accident,” he replied quizzically. “You are thinking of another technician.”

“Oh, you wouldn’t remember it, probably,” M13 said, reassuringly. “It happened near the end of the day, and it was quite a powerful electrical shock you received. But rest assured that you’ve been given the full medical diagnostic — from me, personally — and you are fit to return to work.”

E09 was still puzzled, but he trusted the medic. At the moment he was more concerned with doing his job properly.

“Are there any repairs or inspections I have to do on the area?”

“A07 wanted me to tell you that that he had E18 and E20 take a look at the problem, and it’s been cleared by management for your safety.”

“I still want to take a look myself, but I appreciate you and A07’s attention. Where did the accident take place?”

“Power grid C30. You had removed various safety panels so we weren’t sure which one caused the problem. I’ve been informed that the whole area was given a minor safety inspection by both electricians and supervisory teams.”

“Thanks, M13.”

“No problem.”

As soon as he was out of sight of the medic, the concern of having been electrocuted left his mind. After all, it had happened many times before, at various severities, as it happened to every other electrician in the factory, especially one with his pedigree. He had never received such a serious shock as to affect his memory, but his memory for the day-to-day wasn’t as important to him. As far as he could tell, his brain wasn’t affected — he still had all of his engineering knowledge. The whole network of chips, fuses, capacitors, amplifiers and more were laid out in his mind, perfectly intact.

He didn’t implicitly trust that the two other electricians had done the inspection to sufficient standards. He hadn’t given them any of their general or specific training, and he knew they normally worked on smaller and virtual systems, so their instincts for bodily safety weren’t inherently reassuring. They were likely assigned to the inspection simply because they’d been available.

He set off across the factory floor — a tightly-ordered arrangement of steel units, transit belts, bright lights and loud noises — to do his routine check of assigned power systems, power relays, and network hubs that he began every morning with. He kept his ears and brain open for signals indicating that something needed his or another electrician’s attention.

Almost as soon as he heard production begin to whir to life, a message came in from a machine operator in weldveying, a general maintenance call for a power failure in a heating unit.

E09 could immediately guess what the problem was, and promptly turned on his heels to head down the long, striped walking path to the machine that had made the call. He didn’t even have to ask, he had resolved this issue more times than he could count. Always — always — they had blown a fuse. The same 1000V cartridge that always blew on the older weldvayer models still in service due to shoddy heating element wiring.  A common enough incident that E09 was already rummaging through his toolbox for the correctly-rated fuse he had dropped into it before talking with M13.

The weldveyer was a long, conveyor-based machine that rapidly heated large pieces of various metal alloys to just the right temperature at which point they could be pushed together, sealed and recooled. The conveyor line was long, with stations for several line operators, who did the work of aligning molds using cast iron tools and precision instruments. The main operator tended to the machine’s more delicate instruments and ensured that they were functioning within normal parameters of dimension and temperature, checking parts all the while.

E09 walked straight past the main operator, giving her a slight knowing nod, and bent down to reach the small bronze panel that covered the fuse box, popping the burnt glass fuse out of its holster and neatly inserting the new one.

The operator signaled to the line workers and, with the ordered turning of seven brass keys, brought the machine back to life. The problem solved, E09 stood up slowly and gave a nod to the operator, a tall, broad woman dressed in a loose-fitting, steel-mesh uniform with countless pockets and zippers, arranged for the precise placement of emergency tools from neck to toe. E09 glanced at her forehead and noticed that her sixth number was different, an N3 instead of his and everybody else’s N1. She must be temporary transfer from another similar factory in the great complex.

As he left the area he glanced at the line workers, all dressed in large white full-body suits, their faces shielded with a thin reflective layer of plexiglass. To make up for their obscured foreheads, their identification numbers had been sewn in large blocky text above their face shields.

No one who didn’t wear a helmet on the job needed name tags on their uniforms, or number tags. Everyone’s number was printed, in the same thick lettering that one could make out from several hundred feet away, across their forehead. In the event of a severe power emergency, the numbers glowed in the dark.

E09 walked slowly down a long, dimly-lit hallway, accompanied by the roaring of generators, regenerators, and cooling fans, part of the literal and figurative support system for factory 8N1. The hallway wasn’t really a hallway, but a narrow space between two giant towers buried beneath the factory floor, two out of fifty that housed electrical components that powered and regulated hundreds of complex machines above them. Enormous amounts of electricity coming from the reactors deep below were shunted and reduced to the maximum necessary current, and then distributed upwards across the floor grid in patterns that E09 knew better than the back of his hand.

He tended to work alone here. There were several other electricians scattered about the “towers”, but they tended to stick to the two or three that they were responsible for. If they happened to be working on adjacent structures, they would rarely interact with each other. They wouldn’t have much to say to each other if they did interact. That was okay, since they all kept themselves pretty busy.

Occasionally, E09 would take laps across the factory floor, checking with machine operators for obvious concerns that he had the know-how to remedy. But the towers were his main area of operation, and he got the most work, the most satisfying work, done crouched down in these long tall passages.

He walked halfway down the hallway to a dark green steel staircase, gratuitously furnished with layers of thick black rubber. He stomped up the stairs in his regulation rubber boots, holding railings of stiff rubber worn down by several hundred pairs of rubber gloves, and headed for the rubber-matted spot where he had somehow been electrocuted.

It was a full day’s work to inspect each section of tower for the usual wear and tear, and if a major repair was necessary, it would throw off the regular itinerary and E09 would have to pick it up again tomorrow, in the wrong place. His itinerary cycled because of this — some days he would start at a top tier, other times at the bottom. But he always did them in the same order. It gave him immense satisfaction.

If he was lucky, he could time his inspections and his walks so he would start at the top of his list first thing the next morning. This also gave E09 immense satisfaction.

Supposedly he had been electrocuted at panel C302-A. This was not satisfying. It was in the middle of his list.

He made his way up two stories of catwalk and marched along the third-story platform, passing and counting each smooth steel panel, with identifying numbers neatly embedded in the steel. Each panel was a three-foot square, stacked two high per level, removable via a quick process that every electrician could do in their sleep. The panels uncovered the inner machinery of the towers, both electrical and mechanical — a maze of components that was E09’s responsibility to navigate, regulate, monitor and repair.

E09’s itinerary wasn’t linear, like some of the other electricians. He jumped around physically in his inspection — start work at panel C115-B, then C114-B, then around to D106-B… whichever made the most sense based on signal flow. A repair or adjustment in one area could affect numerous other components, not just downstream, but upstream as well.

He enjoyed working on these towers. They were reliable. They were the same thing every day. Very few parts ever broke or wore down or had to be replaced. There were a few points of failure, but E09 always had the necessary materials on hand.

He knelt down in front of C302-A, set his toolbox on the landing, and reached inside for the most important tool: a folded-up apparatus with four extendable steel arms, locked together at a black plastic pivot with a latch and a button. He pulled the arms apart and spread them until each arm snapped into place, forming an X with the pivoting device in the center. He aligned the apparatus gently against the panel, with experienced precision, and pressed the button. Little automatic screwdrivers on the end of each arm sprung into action, and within a fraction of a second had unlocked the panel from the wall. E09 set the panel, the pivot arms still attached, to his right, and peered inside.

This section of the tower, near the top, was particularly complex, adding to his concern that the two electricians of lower qualifications hadn’t examined it properly. An LED headlamp strapped to his forehead, just above his ID number, splashed light across a thick red PCB that bore a network of spidery silver solder, navigating a maze of resistors, capacitors, and op amps. This board had a twin, accessible through the panel on the opposite side of the tower. They shared several points, three small transformers, and a series of fuses. The power supply for a computer of considerable size — the brain of a nanometric cutting machine.

He bent down and put one knee inside the tower, on a support platform within, keeping the tip of his other leg’s boot gripped to the mat outside. After a moment of peering into the dark corners between the two boards (intentionally set askew to allow for ease of access) he could see that an oft-overlooked connection between the two was coming loose. A scratched plastic guard neatly concealed a worn seal between the wire and the circuit board’s spidery solder.

He reached back out for his toolbox to grab the auto-solder device, a big yellow tool that provided heat, solder, and vacuum. He turned it on and let it hum for a few seconds to warm up. He knelt back down inside with the tool, reaching for the contact point, and—

And stopped.

Something wasn’t quite right.

Not a physical sensation. Something… more nebulous.

E09 had easily worked at this particular panel thousands of times. And yet something about this time, this specific repair, was different.

Actually, it was different in how remarkably the same it was. He had the suspicion that he had already made this exact movement, with this exact tool, holding his hand this exact way, and reaching for the _exact_ same wire.

It went beyond the memory of a routine. He didn’t know when or why, or how. It was a chilling effect. Like he had already experienced this _exact_ moment, in the past. The past? No, it was literally this moment.

Impossible.

As he sat there, frozen in confusion, he began to notice a strange throbbing behind his right eye. It was there, right at the front of his head, near where his flashlight sat. He loosened the nylon straps that sat the headlamp at the center of his skull before pulling it from his head; but the throbbing didn’t go away.

This was physical. _Pain_. A dull pain in his forehead.

Pain he understood. He was able to deal with rhat. All it took was a little willpower. Like flicking a switch in your brain, to stop the signal flow. Easy. He’d always been able to do it.

But the switch was a little harder to throw when the pain was in his skull. He felt as if he had to navigate around the pain to find it.

And this particular pain wasn’t surface-level. It was a deep pulsating discomfort. Like a bruise with no blood, some sort of swelling in the center of his skull. With each passing second it grew more intense, and the longer he paid attention to it, the more intense it got. It was starting to affect his balance, disorient him, _distract_ him…

And then it clicked. The discomfort abruptly vanished. He didn’t know if it had gone away for good or not — he could think of no cause for the pain. There was no indication that there was an injury. But he had successfully pushed it out of his attention nonetheless.

Relieved, E09 tripped the auto-solder and fixed the frayed wire with confident ease and skill. The inspection done, he gathered up his tools, replaced the panel, folded up his panel remover, and set off down the walkway to the stairs to work two stories below, at panel C102-A. He wanted to ensure that the boards above were getting the right power tolerances, to prevent extra strain on the solder that he had just replaced.

But the pain in his skull returned, later in the day. A mild sensation this time, but still there, still noticeable, still omnipresent. And no matter how hard he tried to find and throw that ever-reliable switch to shut it off, this time the pain would not go away.

At the end of the day, E09 removed his tools and his uniform, and sauntered back through the long facility hallways, where he and his hundred roommates availed themselves of their tight shorts and orange shirts. They all stood in a neat row, side by side, under hot streams of water, and were cleansed of any oils, grease, stains, and dirt that had collected on their bodies since the day's beginning.

By the time he got to the showers, E09 was usually exhausted. The shower gave him a chance to relax after a long, busy day. He didn’t talk to anyone else while they were cleaning themselves, but they had all been just as occupied for the same amount of time.

The weldveyer had failed once more, but E12 had been patrolling the floor at the time and had taken care of it. Everything else had been straightforward. He’d had to replace a few parts, move a few things around. Nothing serious. The day had gone pretty much as expected.

Everyone took showers at different lengths, and E09 was often the last one out. He didn’t have to deal with too much grime, but it was a pleasant sensation, after being in the dry and dusty towers all day, to be doused in moisture. The hot water splashed over his face, and he opened his mouth to swallow some, at the same time letting a stream of urine dribble out of his penis.

Clean bunk beds with fresh mattresses awaited those leaving the showers. The hygroscopic core of the mattresses soaked up any water that came into contact with the area around it, so their passengers could go to sleep cool and refreshed. The lights only went out once everyone was lying down, anticipating the darkness, so E09 never overstayed his welcome under the spray of water for longer than necessary.

The man who slept in the bunk next to him was supine, staring up at the bed above him, when E09 finally exited the showers. His number was HPF8N1-P43. (The P stood for Packaging.)

“Long day?” P43 said, as E09 settled down on his mattress, only a foot and half away.

“About the same.”

“About the same for me too,” said P43, and closed his eyes.

E09 laid back and did the same, and felt the lights flicker out as the red hue behind his eyelids disappeared. He exhaled a long, slow breath, knowing that with another internal flick of a switch that he didn’t even have to make, a calming wave would wash over him, and he would be out in a few seconds, joining everyone around him in deep, blissful sleep.

Except…

Except tonight, he couldn’t. He lay still for some time in the darkness, expecting to lose consciousness any moment and find another morning suddenly awaiting him.

But the darkness was still there. He opened his eyelids tentatively and saw nothing. Pitch black.

He inhaled, starting to panic.

He reached out his arm to grasp a pole of the bed. He couldn’t believe that he was still here, in his quarters, wide awake, unable to do the most basic thing he had been able to do his whole life — instantly fall asleep. He moved his eyes around in every direction but could see only darkness.

He laid there, terrified, feeling droplets of cold water rolling off his body and into the mattress, for what seemed like hours.
