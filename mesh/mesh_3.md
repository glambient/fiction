HPF8N1-E09 went through his day in a distracted daze. As much as he tried to work on his regular business, he kept thinking about his head, which was starting to noticeably itch. He would touch the top of his head every so often and massage the rubber. It helped to spread some of the glue around his cranium, which seemed to have skin-soothing properties, not unlike the water of the nightly shower.

He also thought about P43’s naked body, as well as his own. He constantly considered the way his own body moved and shifted, thinking about all those shapes, occasionally felt through his uniform at the way the ridges of his muscles changed in different poses. His legs would expand when he knelt on them, his arms would stiffen when he lifted his toolbox through a panel opening.

It was all new and fascinating to him. While working on a few transformers that generated considerable heat, he pulled his cap off to let his head breathe, which eased the itching a little. If no one else was going to notice it missing, might as well take it off. It was better to expose it than to simply rely on the cooling gel or whatever it was.

A small EM field emanating from the nanometrics made his bare scalp tingle. He scratched his head absent-mindedly and activated a couple of wires. Nothing dramatic happened. He felt twinges in a couple muscles, and was dizzy for a brief second before his surroundings snapped back into focus, and he could continue with his work.

It was nice to be back in the routine, if only because he could let his mind wander while his body performed automatic motions. He was struck by the number of thoughts that were flowing through his mind. What had once been a silent stream had, with the discovery of his reflection and the circuitry under his invisible hat, exploded into strings of chatter and streams of nonsense, most of which had to do with his work.

Later in the day, when he found himself ahead of schedule, he went upstairs to do his rounds. He thought it was great fun dawdling about the heavy machinery and dutiful workers without his little rubber cap. Everyone who he interacted with did not notice the bright color missing from his head. It crossed his mind that having it off would definitely constitute a safety hazard, but he was getting too much smug satisfaction from its absence.

_Satisfaction? Fun?_ These words were unfamiliar to him, but he knew them. It was like there was a little program in the Mesh that was feeing him names for all these new feelings and experiences. For example, it was calling his cranial electronics the _Mesh_ - with a capital M as if it had some superior impor—

_Weldveying X4G - electrical failure. Requesting electrician_.

A voice — or something resembling a voice — interrupted, striking a cut across his thoughts. He could hear it very vividly, as if it came from within his skull.

It repeated: _Weldveying X4G - electrical failure. Requesting electrician_.

He started walking in the direction of the weldveyer. A mysterious ping in his brain informed him that E14 was also scouting the floor and was going to repair the weldveyer instead. He realized that this was how he’d been receiving messages, without an earpiece or a radio, that it had gone straight from the machine, or some machine, to his brain. It only signaled him when he was within proximity to the failing machine, when he was one of the closest available serviceman.

_This_ was what the Mesh was for! Or at least, one of its purposes. Keeping him connected at all times to the work around him. Everyone who worked in this factory was connected to each other, to the machines.

It was a little eerie.

_Eerie_.

If he could receive transmissions from the Mesh, was there any way he could send them? He’d be able to convey important information to other people in real time, and accelerate the inconvenient and inefficient process of communication with coworkers and supervisors.

Come to think of it, he didn’t really have any other way of communicating with other employees effectively, other than speaking to them. These transmissions were, and always had been, a one-way path.

On his way back down the elevator to the towers, he got an idea. A risky idea, but he could learn a thing or two about the Mesh from it. See if he couldn’t get it to do more than it was intended for. Maybe find a way to transmit some messages around the factory, connect with other people.

He found a dark hiding place at the end of one hall, on the first level of catwalk next to the same chrome wall, and opened his toolbox. He pulled his voltmeter out of a prominent pocket, along with a spool of narrow yellow wire, then rummaged around for his standard-issue Venus unit, a small but versatile battery used for testing and jump-starts.

After some wire cutting and stripping, he arranged the yellow wires into an open circuit connecting the Venus’s battery to the voltmeter, on which he dialed in a very high resistance. The display read 0.5 mA of current.

He tested it gingerly on his finger. Imperceptible. But it would only take a few mA more to cause his diaphragm to seize up, risking respiratory failure. And he wasn’t exactly going through highly resistant skin.

Setting the battery and voltmeter carefully on the ground, he set down his headlamp and angled it so he could see his reflection clearly in the chrome wall. He reached for his cap and peeled it off in a smooth motion, setting it on the floor with the headlamp, upside-down so no glue would touch the floor. He knelt down in front of the wall, and leaned to get a good look at the circuitry in the blurry mirror.

There were a thousand narrow connections going every which way, popping in and out through the scalp’s dessicated pores. In the improved lighting they looked less like wires and more like strands of solder alloy, the lines of metal jagged and connected in sloppy intersections of five or six wires, but tightly arranged in a way that suggested a careful, constructed pattern. He found pairs of tiny, circular integrated circuits implanted at symmetrical points just above each ear, above his forehead, and just behind the crown of his skull. They were both black with a very prominent white **M** printed in one corner, followed by a long string of digits too tiny to read.

He brought the two long, skinny wires connected to the battery and voltmeter, touching his elbows to the wall and shaking his foot to steady his hands. He focused on a little section of crossing wires at the crown of his skull at the very top of his vision, one overlapping the other, and hovered the two test wires over them. He felt a sense of nervousness, a brief moment of hesitation, but pushed through, letting his finger drop the inch that connected the exposed end of the yellow wire to his scalp.

A flood of information nearly knocked him off his knees — all the circuits and flow networks that he’d worked on in the towers seemed to reach his mind at the same time, in the mental imagery he’d used to memorize it — almost resembling blueprint diagrams — dissections of capacitors, resistor codes, computer cores, representations of complex pathways of energy and data, where one ended and another began and how they were connected.

He lifted his hands quickly from his head, gripping the wires hard. He felt wiped out — that exhausting quantity of data had flashed by in the span of just a couple seconds. He breathed heavily and slowly, regaining a sense of baseline. He continued kneeling in front of the wall, hidden from view of any onlookers by the platforms and railings, and turned his attention to another fascinating star pattern on the right side of his head. Impulsively he went for it.

He started salivating the instant the contact was made. The impression of a beautiful long-lost meal made itself known on his tongue. He could almost smell it for real, _taste_ it, had barely been able to taste anything this powerfully before — in fact, compared to this, it was like he had never been able to taste anything at all. The taste that he imagined, that he dreamed about, had a sparkling, crackling flavor that swam around his mouth, striking every square millimeter of his tongue and cheek like miniature explosions.

He found the word for it eventually. _Sweet_. It was pleasant, and pleasant in a new way that he didn’t quite understand.

He lifted his hand once more, breaking contact, and the sweetness faded to a pale memory. His mouth dried up as the taste disappeared into nothingness.

A map was forming in his head. He was inventing names for each of these connections as the new sensations were introduced. The _blueprint access relay_. The _sweet spot_.

He became fascinated by a wide symmetrical asterisk, just off center of his forehead. A circle of eight evenly pointed lines, all pointing to an invisible center, possibly connecting below the surface. The tendrils were skinny but they seemed to extend for an unusually long distance, far longer than any of the other paths running across his cranium. The two longest wires pointed directly to the left and to the right, diving beneath the skin just a couple centimeters from the two round circuits placed there.

Getting his hands back into a steady place, he brought the testing wires up to his forehead to make a bridge between the two longest pathways.

A burst of energy struck his consciousness, and his head started reeling. His eyes went wide, his chest lifted, and the reflections in the wall started to swim. The lines of solder were glimmering and shining like he had never seen them shine before, radiating a million colors that streaked and _exploded_ out of the wall. They lifted from his head on their own, began to move and sway across the scalp, circling around each other, the crossings unclear, the space between him and the wall expanding even as he kneeled frozen still, and his shoulders became bigger and his mouth opened to take in the air and the air was full of light and sounds and the _hummmmm_ of the computer towers became so loud and he could hear every overtone singing screaming so powerfully and he thought the _ludicrous_ amount of energy that was rocketing through those massive obelisks and him so miniscule in comparison but how could he even _comprehend _controlling all of those circuits and that _infinite_ maze of wires all arranged so perfectly and ideally going on for miles and miles and miles up and down and through and around the corner and around this other corner splitting here blossoming _blooming_ and he was caught transfixed in the center of it all all all kneeling here staring at the _delicate_ metal tapestry adoring the crown of his machine of flesh and blood so different from those behemoths _pulsing_ and _vibrating_ and _shaking_ and powered by air and _humbled_ to be interacting and communicating with these chthonic creatures of enormous _power_ and unbelievable immesaurable incomprehensible complexity and all of the other machines and the _people_ the people whose eyes he couldn’t see before and now could see them and their existence and they are as complex as he is but he can only just now just here conceive that much and —

It was gone.

Everything snapped back to normal again. The walls stopped moving. He wasn’t moving.

His hands hovered over the line of wire. It didn’t blind him, didn’t shimmer.

He stared at the eight-pointed star for a long time. He could see long-hidden veins that criss-crossed just below the skin throbbing with blood. He committed the star to permanent memory, tried to remember the unbelievably intense feeling, which the subtle foreign voice was telling him was called _awe_.

E09’s attention continued to wander as he cleaned himself in the end-of-day shower. He was truly exhausted, his brain was dealing with another headache that had started during his cranial tinkering and hadn’t let up. He put his face under the stream of water and let his thoughts drift.

The showers were arranged in two rows and hundreds wide, with no walls — simply red bars separating the drainage areas where each person would stand in a four-foot square metal stall. Each shower had its own drain directly below, with the source of the spray directly above. M13 was standing in front of him. E09 had just begun to notice the arrangement of showers, as he tended to get into the correct one automatically, without seemingly any instruction or guidance system, even though every entry point in the wide expanse looked exactly the same. It was surreal, but it would be naïve not to assume that something in the Mesh was driving that automatic process of walking him to and from his dormitory.

Strange and unfamiliar words had continued to enter his thoughts all day. The feeling was like having another person floating inside his head, an external dictionary that performed an automatic lookup. He had been trying to communicate with it, but like the normal communications they went only in one direction. It showed up when he experienced something he wasn’t familiar with, gave it a name. Today, he had learned about not just _awe_ and _sweetness_ but also things like _disgust_ and _embarrassment_ and _delusion_. And the dictionary had given a name to familiar sensations like _confusion_ and _fatigue_ and _pride_. The names helped him understand that these feelings were not chaotic, that there was a pattern to them, a cause and effect. Touching this wire produced this sensation. Something that happened this way made him feel that thing.

He wanted to see if other people around him had the same Mesh in their heads. He wanted to find out very, very badly. And so, exhausted as he might have been, he was eager to perform a little experiment that he had concocted on his downtime after late meal.

P43 was standing in the shower inset next to him, arms to the sky. The water was dampening his own cap and outlining a few of the more prominent pieces of equipment beneath it. As the men moved around in the shower, E09 got the impression that at least the six circles of those integrated circuits were in roughly the same place on his companion’s head. Good to know.

He adjusted his own cap, which now had a seventh circle poking out from underneath.

He got out of the shower quickly to prepare. Sitting down on the bed, he drew his hand along the back edge of the insulating rubber until his fingers poked into a couple of bare wires sticking out of it.

This wire was steel, it wasn’t the stuff his Mesh was made of. He very carefully lifted the back of his cap and pulled the contraption out from underneath it.

A tiny lithium battery, one that held only a few millivolts of charge, was the centerpiece of his little assembly. He had pulled it out of a backup system that almost certainly wouldn’t be needing it anytime soon, and expertly glued it with a silicon insulating substance to two very short yellow testing wires, which he now bent slightly into a more circular shape for an easier grip. He lay down and palmed the wires in his left hand as P43 exited the shower.

E09 had debated for a long time whether to perform the experiment while his roommate was awake or asleep. He had settled on asleep because it was unlikely he would be able to convince P43 to remove his cap while he was awake. He might react like the doctor had done yesterday — with _confusion _and _anger_.

It was another couple minutes before the lights went out, but it seemed like P43 had been asleep since his head hit the mattress. He must’ve had a long and tiring day, too, thought E09. All that constant movement.

E09, faced with a burning curiosity, sprang into action as soon as his eyes had comfortably adjusted to the dim light. He swung his feet out over the edge of the bed and folded them under his body as he settled into a kneeling position on the floor, his hand resting on the edge of the adjacent mattress. Very carefully, E09 reached up and picked at the edge of P43’s cap, slid a finger underneath, and lifted, pulling the cap up from his forehead without quite removing it entirely. The rubber’s adhesive kept it out of his way as he folded it neatly with two hands over the man’s crown.

The dark blue light bounced off the shiny soldered wires very distinctly, and E09 had no trouble discerning the familiar pattern of circuits and solder across P43’s forehead. The head was bigger, differently shaped, but the organization of circuitry was more or less identical to E09’s. Right in the front of his forehead, just above his ID number, was that same large outstretched star pattern.

E09 reached his left arm back to the wires still on his bed and hovered it over the star, trying to gauge how far apart the ends of the wires needed to be for a solid connection. He adjusted the testing wires at their roots, and steadily brought the device down to make contact with the stars — first one end, then the other.

P43 twitched violently. His eyes flew completely open, so fast that the lids made an audible sound. He jerked out of sleep, his head lifting suddenly. The ends of the improvised device scraped across his head, inadvertently coming into contact with a number of other criss-crossing wires.

E09 froze when P43 gasped for breath and a loud sound escaped his mouth, an indiscriminate bark of… something… perhaps pain. P43 turned to face E09, who was backing away in terror from the death glare in his test subject’s eyes, which were locked onto his. E09’s hand caught the metal frame of the bed as he swung it for a grip, the back of his palm smacking against the metal corner of the railing. The battery was sent flying out of his grasp and onto the floor. He tried to pull himself up to the bed with the other hand, but as he grabbed the mattress it slid carelessly onto the floor, preventing him from getting a firm hold. His foot slipped as he fell sideways on his back.

P43 sat up and reached out for E09, who couldn’t get off his butt fast enough to avoid the massive, calloused hand reaching for his throat. The man dove with tremendous speed and grabbed E09’s neck with one hand, pushing him farther into the bedframe. He squeezed hard and let out another animalistic yell, this one clearly a long drawn-out scream of anger, and his other hand lifted up of its own accord and fell with a closed fist across E09’s right cheek.

The force of the impact sent E09 sprawling out of his assailant’s grip, sideways again, hsi tumble barely arrested by the mattress half on the ground. P43 clambered forward to grab hold of E09’s shoulder and swung again wildly from above, landing a solid blow against an elbow that E09 had instinctively raised in defense. Another blow from P43 struck his other elbow, and he fell all the way to the ground, protecting his head from more damaging force by extending his fingers to cover as much of his thin rubber helmet as he could.

Each fist making contact was a moment of terror that dulled his senses. Every blow to his arms and body hurt more and more but mattered less and less. P43 continued to wail on him, barking and yelling, on and on, landing blow after blow as E09 thrashed about on the floor, kicking his legs wildly in a blind attempt to destabilize his attacker and escape his reach.

A handful of people in nearby bunks whose fragile sleep had never been interrupted before, who were unaccustomed to _any_ unexpected bump in the night, were startled awake by the sounds of kicking and screaming. But they were lost and unseeing in the darkness, until the morning lights unceremoniously flickered on, several hours too early, and a deafeningly loud alarm that hadn’t been heard in years began to scream.
