“Talk to me. Tell me what happened.”

“He was downstairs repairing a tower unit. Panel C3o2-A. A current must have jumped from a line to the platform.”

“It is serious?”

“No, there’s been no visible damage to any tissue. Dermis is intact. The current must not have been severe. He was properly grounded though, so I’m not sure—”

“How was he when you found him?”

“He was spread out facedown on the floor. He was mumbling a great deal of nonsense. From the looks of it he’d been there for a few minutes.”

“This is serious. There must be an issue with grounding within the tower. Get E18 to have a look at it.”

“I intend to have someone look at it, but you should know that E09 has more experience with the power grid for the nanometric than anyone here.”

“Understood, however, another pair of eyes will be useful in detecting problems that E09 might have overlooked as a regular technician.”

“His eyes are opening. It looks like he’s gaining focus in them.”

“Have you determined the point of electrical contact?”

“No. As you can see, I’ve already removed much of his uniform. I couldn’t find burn marks of any kind. This bruise here is from falling down onto the floor without—”

“Look.”

“Pardon?”

“_Look_.”

“Where?”

“His forehead. Right in the front. There’s a tiny wire sticking out of it.”

“There?”

“Yes, it’s exposed.”

“That must have been the point of contact.”

“Take him to the Mesh crew. Tell them to perform a reset on that pathway.”

“…”

“Yes?”

“Sorry… Mesh crew?”

“Never mind. Bring him to medical and I’ll see to it that he’s transferred.”

“Of course.”
