HPF8N1-E09 was startled by the movement of people on either side of him. The person assigned the bunk to his left clambered down, shaking the frame, the arches of her feet slapping against the plastic rungs of the ladder at the foot of the bed.

E09’s head lifted up from the mattress, and it immediately dropped back down, expelling an audible groan he couldn’t control. His head was unbearably heavy. He couldn’t understand why. It was the same head, there was no helmet or other apparatus on it to weigh it down.

But he felt bad. Tired. Sick. He got up slowly, a pervasive soreness permeating every muscle in his upper body, like he would get after bending over for too long at an awkward angle.

He had woken up late, hadn’t come to when the lights flickered on. Something was wrong.

As he stumbled his way out his door, the memory started to return. A memory of all the lights going out, like they always did, and him lying there in his bed, the only person awake in a room full of dozens of peacefully sleeping coworkers.

He didn’t know how long he had lain there awake, or when he’d finally drifted off to sleep.

The rest of the people in the dormitory had already disappeared by the time he reoriented himself. He scrambled to follow them while putting on his shirt and shorts.

As E09 made his way to work, no one seemed to acknowledge, or even notice, his disorientation. Everyone else stood upright and walked straight as an arrow down the labyrinth of hallways and elevators, moving at the same pace. Everyone walking at the same speed.

The longer he walked, the less the exhaustion bothered him. Down these stairs, take a right here, into this elevator, follow the crowd two hundred feet, then left, into the mess hall…

The mess hall was a huge room, brightly lit, made to fit all two hundred people who worked in factory 8N1. All the workers sat at long tables, on benches just as long, seated equidistant from each other. On either side, near the doors, were wall units that dispensed custom-made meals for each person depending on the slight differences in their nutritional requirements, as well as accommodating for their general build and the physical demands of their occupation.

A camera read E09’s number as he stepped up to the first unit he could reach and pressed the button. After a few seconds of processing and humming, a small port opened and a silver tray slid out at waist height, carrying his morning meal. Today the meal was brownish in color with flecks of red and gray, accompanied by a large tin spoon placed on a white napkin.

He ate his meal with haste and, despite being the last one to receive his tray of food, was one of the first to enter the cleaning room.

Out of the corner of his eye he saw the same medic, his bunkmate, that had chatted with him yesterday morning as they both collected their respective equipment. The medic didn’t see him; he was too busy conversing with one of his assistants.

It wasn’t an important enough issue to talk to the medics about his lack of sleep. It would be best if he just went straight back down to the towers, where he was the most comfortable and the most useful.


---

By the time he had settled into his routine, the soreness wasn’t irritating him anymore, and he was wide awake. The excitement to be starting his workday overshadowed any personal discomfort he might have been experiencing. He started at C204-A, close to where he had been yesterday, working on another nanometric computer power supply, and made his way down the row to several other similar units. Then he tinkered with the opposite tower that formed the base of the carbonic analyzers, calibrating and fine-tuning the power outputs with his extremely sensitive voltmeter, which ensured that his readings were accurate.

It was several hours before he made his way back around to the first nanometric computer, where he had been zapped two days before. Here he was again, unfolding the panel remover, extending the arms, and locking it to the varnished steel panel.

His mind began to wander. How many times had he unfolded this device? Too many to count. The motion for him was smooth, he noticed that he had almost mastered unfolding and extending at the same time. Pulling it out of the bag, and seconds later attaching it to the panel, button pressed, a little air whooshing out of the opening in the wall, and he was at work. It was more natural than walking.

How many times had he cracked open C302-A? He must be opening three hundred of these panels every day. Three hundred panels, out of three hundred and eighty four that he was responsible for.

The thought unsettled him, for a moment. He placed his tools down, turning it over in his mind, distracted by the thought. The same three hundred and eighty four panels, every day.

He gazed into the panel, saw the transformer, the assortment of knobs and dials that he was responsible for tuning, the procedure he could do more rapidly than even E04 could. He had seen and touched all these parts before, hundreds and hundreds of times.

He looked out of the dark cavernous opening in the tower to his right, at the panel leaning up against the wall. His eyes passed over the number embedded in its steel surface. It shimmered in the dim overhead light, a blocky C302-A in the upper right corner of. The panel was leaning up against another panel, C303-A. After that, C304-A, then C305-A, C306-A…

All he did was open panels. All he did was tinker and poke around these big boxes of electronics.

All he knew were these towers.

Suddenly he felt exhausted, almost as if all his hardworking energy had been sucked out of him. In his cross-legged position he slumped over, placing his voltmeter on the ground. His head dropped down to his chest and he stared at the platform. A thousand tiny holes of worn black rubber filled his vision.

He _had_ to calibrate the carbonic analyzer. But he didn’t_ want_ to.

He decided to skip this section, and placed the panel back in its holster, locking it with a flick of the remover latch to reverse, followed by a somber press of the center button.

He’d calibrated this part yesterday. He had the urge to break routine and to focus on something a little more… what was the right way to put it… _uncertain_.

(Maybe this _was _something he should talk to the medics about.)

A problem area, something that needed his real attention. Something to do, maybe, with that pesky weldveyer that was probably breaking down even at this moment. But the weldveyer was on the other side of the complex of towers, all the way over in row RR. The responsibility of E21 and E31. Two very competent people.

He assumed that he’d have to get permission from one of the senior electricians, E03 or E04, or maybe a general supervisor like A24, to take a look at that section of tower. They might understand if he argued for a second or third opinion of the situation over there, another pair of eyes to determine why the delicate instrument broke down several times a day, delaying production.

E09 dropped the voltmeter into his toolbox and stood up to move on to his next project. Might as well continue his itinerary for now.

As he straightened himself he happened to glance at the wall at the far end of the hallway, adjacent to the first panel in the row. He detected a movement and a flash of color.

He froze.

He had never really paid attention to the wall at the end before. It was plated, from ground to ceiling crossing several stories, with a layer of chrome, lightly warped by the residual heat rising from the machines.

And in the wall, visible amongst the silver streaks and little rainbows, surrounded by sketchy patterns of green and gray, was a huge blob of yellow.

Why was there a yellow stain on the wall?

E09 stared at it for few seconds, fixated, before realizing that the shade of the blob imprinted in the wall was _the exact_ same shade as his uniform. He looked down to check. Yes, the same shade.

He moved to the left a little bit. As his perspective changed, the blob moved.

He lifted his right arm into the air, lifting the sleeve of the loose-fitting uniform, and its elastic wristband, with it. The blob in the wall grew an appendage.

The realization hit him harder than one thousand volts to the face.

The blob was _him_.

It was a murky reflection of his uniform. A _reflection_. He had seen things reflected in other chrome-plated objects, always distorted, but had never seen _himself_ reflected.

He stepped forward, so close to the wall it began to condensate with his breath. _His_ breath. Fogging up the mirror image. With every second he lingered, staring at the confusing image, the reflection became clearer and increasingly, unmistakably, him.

Above the yellow depiction of his body was the pale imitation of what must have been his own face. He removed the glove from his right hand and reached one finger to it, and it felt the touch of skin. His cheek was like warm rubber, but smoother, a little oily, giving a little under the pressure of his fingertip.

He followed the image of his finger as it moved around his lips, then his nostrils. He touched each dark part of his face in fascination as it came into his awareness, and squirmed when he accidentally sent a finger into one eyeball. A tiny droplet appeared in the depression of the eye socket, and he delicately brought his finger down and smeared it along his cheek. It felt wet. _Water?_

Then his fingers traced another black smudge above the bony ridge of his eyebrows. He made it out clearly in the warped chrome. Numbers and letters, his own identification code, HPF8N1-E09, in the same place that everyone around him had theirs. He had never seen this number anywhere but on paperwork. The big, imposing backwards text in the wall broadly covering the entire space between his temple, above his eyes and below his—

His—

It suddenly occurred to him that he had never looked above the number on his head, or anyone else’s head. Had never assumed that there was anything worth seeing there, nothing above the number that needed to be paid attention to. Yet now, staring at a reflection of his body, there was _something_ there to look at, above the reversed code.

An orange semicircle shape sat atop his mirror image. Small, the same width as his face, the same color as his undershirt.

He reached up to touch it. He could feel it in his fingers, but no corresponding feeling in his head, which was surprisingly numb. The shape was cold and rough in texture, but it didn’t feel like his skin. It felt like… like plain rubber.

A finger explored the boundary between the foreign rubber and his forehead, where the number was printed. He felt his skin under the finger in the tan part of the forehead, but when he moved it to the orange part, the feeling stopped. A smooth transition from skin to rubber. He traced his finger across the boundary, which extended all the way around the circle of his head, behind his ear and down to the very top of his neck, on both sides.

The top of his head was an orange rubber dome.

He pressed on his forehead, hard, and the rubber moved to the side under the pressure. More skin! There was more skin _under_ the rubber dome.

E09 was completely transfixed. He had long ago dropped the glove he held his other hand, and it had fallen over the platform’s railing. He hadn’t even heard the reverberating slap as the glove landed on the floor two stories below.

His finger pulled on the rubber as he peeled it from his scalp. The material was razor-thin at the edge but tapered thicker as he got more of a grip on it. With a finger and thumb he started pulling it from his head, and tendrils of gooey transparent glue appeared underneath, stretching as the cap came free. In one long, slow motion, he removed it from his skull.

His grip weakened as his hand moved across his head, and saw what was underneath. The chrome was not so blurry that he couldn’t make it out with the eyes of a seasoned electrician.

Beneath a thin layer of sticky insulating glue, covering every previously obscured surface, was a vast network of bare wires, each barely a tenth of a millimeter wide, going in and out of his head, accompanied by hundreds of little electrical components — miniscule amps and resistors and integrated circuits and little LED status lights, blinking in cycles — all embedded in the damp, white skin of a scalp that he didn’t even know he had.

He tried to touch one of the wires with his bare finger, his usually steady auto-soldering hand trembling. His finger came into contact with several wires at once and a spasm violently ricocheted down his body and through his left leg. He fell, hard, into the panel to his right.

The cap fell out of his left hand and landed on the insulator mat. A string of glue stretched along the floor from the cap to his limp hand. He lay there for a couple minutes slumped over, frozen in shock.

He turned his head back to his reflection in the wall, staring at the virtual circuit board that topped his head.

These components weren’t part of him. They were part of a machine. He was not a machine. He was a worker, a person.

He _tended_ to these kinds of things, and he’d never known there was a huge array covering his head!

How did they get there? How long had they been there? Why hadn’t he bothered to notice them before? How was it that nobody _else_ had noticed them before?

It was _weird_ to have those electronics up there.

He gingerly touched his finger, steady now, pushing around the glue, to another wire above his head. A warmth rushed through him, so quickly he almost gasped. A pleasant feeling. Similar to the feeling of water on his body during the evening shower, but coming from within. He held his finger there.

A couple LEDs started to blink faster, others slower. He took a long breath in, then out. He felt the murky air rush into his lungs, coat his insides, expand his chest, and then escape. The outside world fell away as his eyes drifted out of focus.

His arm became weightless, out of his control, and his finger lifted from the wire. Abruptly the good feeling ceased, and E09’s world was thrust back into focus.

A very familiar throbbing pain starting to appear behind his right eye. He looked into the chrome and touched the nearest wire he could think of to the pain’s origin. Another spasm, this time shooting through his neck, but not as powerful, only making his head twitch a couple centimeters to the left. He tentatively touched another wire near the previous one, and got the sensation that_ he had already done this_.

No — that was impossible. By any standard of reason he was absolutely certain that he had never been sitting here, looking at wires visibly poking out of his head, feeling the soft breeze of air from cooling fans moving across his scalp. It was ridiculous.

As the uncanny feeling faded he recognized it as the same genre of memory as yesterday, the past meeting the present, the illusion of having impossibly lived a present experience in a previous time.

He got up, clawed at the orange cap, and stuffed it into one of the front pockets of his uniform. He needed a doctor. He was losing his grip on reality. He had wires poking out of his head.

Leaving his toolbox and glove behind, he made his way to the middle of the platform, bolted down the stairs, and headed for one of the freight elevators stationed at the end of the rows of towers.

The elevators were little more than yellow steel platforms, railings, and exposed pulley systems, each surrounded on three sides by dark steel-plated walls. Electricity hummed loudly in E09’s ears, more loudly than he could remember ever hearing before. He pressed a blue button on one of the railings and held on as the electric-assisted pulleys whirred and whistled, pulling him up to the factory floor at considerable speed. Disoriented, he was hyper-aware of moving air generating little gasps of static electricity between wires that had once been stuffed under the cap and were now bending out of their usual shape, threatening to make connections that had never been made, and likely shouldn’t.

When the elevator reached the main floor, he disembarked and started to weave his way through the maze of aisles to the medical bay at an agitated jog. It was hard to run in boots that held so much insulation, and he was in too much of a panic to use his communicator. Other people walked around him, going about their regular work.

For a moment he slowed down to gawk at his fellow employees. Every human being that he could see on the floor had the same identical orange rubber dome atop their exposed heads. All of them. And no one had ever noticed or pointed out the oddly-colored skin, no one had ever touched it or had their attention drawn to it, their eyes never showing them what was above the letters and numbers printed on someone else’s face.

He was stunned. It occurred to him that he had _never_ _looked_ at the space above the numbers, never noticed the off-color rubber that adorned everyone’s heads.

He bolted into a run.


---

The medical bay was located in a small room set into one of the factory floor’s massive walls, near the entrance to the mess hall. HPF8N1-M07 was loitering at the open booth adjacent to the double-doored entrance, separated from E09 by a thin pane of plexiglass.

“What’s the problem, E09?” the doctor straightened up, assumed a stance of knowing and authority. A doctor, not a medic.

E09 was panting so hard he practically fell against the shelf that jutted from the doctor’s booth. He thought he could feel his scalp buzzing with energy and the skin just beneath, which was slowly gaining new sensations, pulsing with blood.

He pointed at his head. “What’s this?”

“What’s what?”

“This!” E09 exclaimed, his pointer finger creeping closer to, but hesitating to touch, the top of his scalp. “Look!”

The doctor craned his neck. “I don’t see anything unusual there.”

“Look!” E09 raised his voice. “Up here, above my face!”

“Your ID number?”

“No! Above that.”

M07 glared at him, his eyes making contact with E09’s. His gaze was a blank stare. E09 felt his heart drop.

The stupid doctor wasn’t looking.

He couldn’t see.

Not even the medics could see the top of his head. Not even the people trained to know the human body could see the glued-on layer of rubber atop each of their patient’s scalps, or in this case the lack thereof.

“Don’t you see?” he exclaimed, lowering his voice. “Electrical components? Look at them!”

The doctor glanced up, his eyes glossing over E09’s forehead. E09 could see his eyes through the glass, saw them lose focus when they traced upwards.

“I don’t see any electrical components sticking out of your head.”

“Are you sure? Look again.”

The doctor frowned. “There’s nothing there,” he said curtly. “Please do not waste my time unless you have a real emergency.”

E09 slammed his hand down on the shelf in frustration. It was an unexpected reaction, and the high ranking doctor flinched ever so slightly.

E09 was surprised by himself. He looked puzzlingly at his reacting hand, then quickly retracted it to his pocket. He stammered a quick “sorry” and felt heat rush to his face, then turned quickly to leave.

He could somehow sense the doctor’s eyes watch him as he walked back to the elevator. Those blank unseeing eyes, and yet presumably more secure in judgment than his own. E09 knew electronics, but those doctors knew the human body.

He wasn’t sure what to think. He was terrified of these things attached to him that he’d never noticed before. He was concerned about why the wires were placed there. But he was also comforted by the doctor’s assertions that there was nothing wrong with him. An internal battle raged between his respect for the profession and his own perceptions. Why couldn’t he reconcile them? Why couldn’t he pick?

He didn’t trust that doctor anymore. He was wrong. He couldn’t believe he was thinking that. _They were wrong._ There _was_ something there.

He was going to keep this to himself, for now.

He’d made it all the way back to the elevators before he realized that it was almost time for the evening meal. The day had gone by so fast, but one glance at the clock in his uniform and he knew that the late meal was going to start in a matter of minutes.

He turned on his heels on the platform and strolled, fuming, in the direction from which he came. He could be the first one to the meal room, might even be ahead of the bell if he walked a little faster.

He got to the mess hall just as a high-pitched sine tone sounded all across the factory. He instantly started salivating.

The only worker in the mess hall so far, he scanned his number at the closest meal unit right next to the entryway. His tray was dispensed, his meal a translucent yellow mass with chunks of a mysterious brown substance floating inside of it. After the shock of his discovery he was starving for some normal food.

He sat down at a table as the other factory workers began to trickle in, a few people at a time. He realized he had forgotten to remove the bulk of his uniform, and had to move several tools on his heavy belt out of the way before he could plant himself comfortably on the bench. Everyone else around him had stripped down to the essentials; if they had bulky uniforms or helmets they’d stopped at the cleanroom before coming in.

Every single worker in the room had one of those sheets of rubber covering their heads. A sea of orange headgear.

It was surreal, a mass of orange-headed people; where once he had just seen _people_, now he was shocked by the new awareness of the insulator caps _en masse_.

He felt a tightness in his chest. An unpleasant feeling. He remembered that his own cap was still in one of his pockets. He felt the urge to put it back on, hide the electronics, pretend that everything was normal.

He fumbled awkwardly in a pocket and found one glove. He found the cap in another pocket, still sticky with glue. Turning it around, he found the appropriate shape and gingerly placed it back on his head, stretching and pushing down around the rim to secure the seal, making sure not to touch any of the electronics. He didn’t think anyone would notice if his cap was crooked, since he was clearly the only person who looked above anyone’s face, and no one had commented or stared when they had walked in and found a man with wires where there shouldn’t be.

_Idiots_, he thought, and once again was momentarily startled by his own caustic choice of word.

He wolfed down his yellow meal, his thoughts drifting with all the new information, his eyes darting around. He stared at all his coworkers, people who he saw every day, people who he recognized in the hallway, the showers, or in the sleeping quarters — all looking a little more like strangers, with new distinct features coming into view.

Nobody talked while they were eating. They talked all the time on the factory floor, communicating instructions, conversing politely — but in this huge room with hundreds of people, no one said a word. All E09 heard was the clinking of spoons against silver trays, and the occasional loud swallow or burp.

Why did this seem strange to him, all of a sudden? It wasn’t _actually _strange or unusual — just an observation he had never made before.

“Hey,” he whispered to the worker seated next to him. The man, a line worker at a place in the factory he rarely visited, said nothing and continued eating. His meal was a solid, textured greenish mass, that crumbled a little bit whenever the man dipped his spoon into it. His eyes were focused on the meal, and he moved with a solemn rhythm. Spoon down, then up into his mouth, chew a little bit, swallow. Spoon down again.

E09 looked back at his yellow meal, then at the line worker’s fluffy little cakelike mound. His mouth started salivating again.

Without thinking, he grabbed his tray, grabbed his companion’s tray, and switched their positions. To his astonishment, the other man dipped his spoon right into E09’s yellow jelly, and continued eating, looking down at the tray as if nothing had changed, as if he was still eating his own meal, which had actually moved to the seat next to him.

E09’s eyes brightened. He stuck his own spoon down into the food in front of him. It was satisfying — not because it was better in any way, but because it was new.

He had _stolen_ food.

The word appeared in his mind.

_Stolen_.

He had never heard the word before. But he was _stealing_. It gave him a mild thrill, the kind he got when he solved a difficult problem. He had stolen, and now he was eating a different, better, meal. And no one noticed, no one cared. _He had gotten away with it._

He almost choked on the cake.


---

The diabolical excitement carried him as he went through the rest of his day. He broke his routine once or twice more, jumping around in his itinerary where things were noticeably out of shape. The branches of parallel routines in the magnetic analyzer that were drawing a little too much energy were observed and calibrated outside of their usual order.

At the end of the day he tore off his uniform and walked briskly back to the showers, full of energy, hoping that the showers might calm him down. But he cleaned himself much more quickly than usual, rubbing his hands all over his body without really caring whether or not every corner and crevice was clean. He was one of the first to sprint out of the showers and hop onto his bed.

P43 made his way into the dormitory and sat down his bunk a few moments later, his face blank and ready for sleep, while E09 lay staring up at the mattress suspended above, his own face beaming.

“How was your day?” asked P43.

“Superb,” said E09. “I learned a lot.”

“Oh, were you in a training course?”

The corners of E09’s mouth tensed up, stifling an uncharacteristic reaction. But he couldn’t hold it in. A loud laugh escaped his mouth. P43 didn’t react.

“I guess you could say that,” E09 grinned broadly. _Grinned_.

Other people began to file into the dormitory and P43 lay down, the conversation over. E09 turned his head and watched him stretch out, watched his roommate’s face relax as the man let a pleasurable wave of sedation leak out of his brain and down his spinal cord, which stretched and lengthened with the good feeling.

E09 tried to do the same, but once again he couldn’t. His heart was still racing, he wasn’t going to get any sleep tonight. He could still feel electricity course through his body, even through the air. Or was that the wires in his head? What were those wires really doing to him?

He gazed at P43, jealous of the ease by which his roommate drifted off to sleep. A peaceful smile gently spread across P43’s face. E09 felt a smile cross his own — just seeing the man happy was comforting. It eased his own sudden and racing thoughts a little bit.

P43 was just a little bit taller and wider than E09. A man who did a lot of moving, and lifting, whose legs and arms were thick and bumpy with muscle. E09 was fascinated. His own bony arms lay limp at his sides, optimized more for the fine motor control required for electronics repair.

When the entire contingent had assembled in their supine sleeping positions, the lights went out. But they didn’t go out completely. E09 had typically fallen asleep too quickly to notice the soft blue glow that radiated ever so slightly from small strips along the headboard of the bed. But each bed had them, and after a long time lying awake with his eyes open, the glow began to reveal itself. The lights didn’t actually get brighter, but his eyes adjusted to the darkness. He could see no colors, only shapes.

The glow illuminated P43’s body, which was cast in shadow and contour. A sculpture with a unique form, crooked and uneven but somehow well-organized. E09 followed the lines of his shoulders, the detailed muscles in his arms. The man’s smooth, usually pale skin was now a high-contrast blue and black shadow.

E09 was fascinated and leaned up on his arm to get a better look at the man, laid straight out in his bed. He watched P43’s belly rise and fall with slow, deep, soothing breaths. He slowly reached a finger across the space between their beds and traced a ridge of hard muscle that led from his belly down to between his legs.

P43 didn’t flinch at the touch, but E09 felt ecstatic. Something like the rush he got before he went to sleep, but instead of a soothing rush it was exciting, like the feeling of stealing. Instead of slowing down, his heartbeat sped up.

E09 leaned over even more, lowering a leg to the floor to balance himself as he felt more and more compelled to touch his sleeping companion. He felt the skin of P43’s stomach with his whole hand, the smooth and still slightly damp flesh warm against his palm. He spent many minutes studying every ridge and curve with his hands, from head to toe, totally transfixed by the human body lying there peacefully in its bed. P43 didn’t move a muscle, save his steadily expanding and contracting diaphragm.

It felt good to touch him. E09 wondered what it felt like to be touched in this way. As his right hand rested on P43’s arm, he let his other hand feel his own skin, moving with a flat palm across his chest and stomach.

His own body was just as naked and smooth. The ridges and curves weren’t as well-defined as P43’s. But he experienced good sensations as his cold hand traced the lines of his skin. He found that certain parts of his body that were more sensitive than others, some so sensitive that they almost hurt to touch. He felt pain if he pressed down too much, his finger pushing against something hard.

His penis was most sensitive of all. This little shriveled object that did nothing but dispense dirty yellow urine was _extraordinarily_ sensitive.

He had never explored his body like this before. It was a flood of new information and feelings.

He grabbed onto his penis and was astonished to find it bigger than he remembered it. And a little stiffer too, like a muscle. He felt his whole body stretch involuntarily, shivering with energy.

He relaxed totally and let his hand rest there, between his legs. The good feeling was magnitudes more powerful than the usual hypnagogic calm. Before another thought could cross his mind, he had drifted off to sleep, a loose, lopsided smile on his face.
