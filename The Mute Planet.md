“Okay, so, did you know what happened to this species called the Talsoquians?”

“No,” Lule confessed. “I’ve never even heard of them.”

“Oh boy,” said Trevor, leaning back in his chair. “It’s a wild story, but it’s mostly in fables and legends and stuff. Not ours, of course. It’s ancient history for the Andrometes.”

“How ancient?” I said, trying to keep Trevor engaged while we waited.

“Like, I think, our 19th century or something. I mean, that’s when the whole thing ended. So, maybe like, 17th to 19th century. I could be wrong.”

He sipped from his container quickly, wanting to hurry the story along. Trevor liked to tell stories, things he picked up in passing, in conversations, interstellar rumors, trivia. He was full of them. We had a lot of time to kill, so I’m sure this wasn’t the only tale we were going to hear.

“Right, so basically, the first time that the Andrometes located extraterrestrial intelligent life, they did what any reasonable, curious species would do, which is direct every micron of their attention and communication towards it. No contact, naturally, they hadn’t quite reached lightspeed transportation yet, but they had just discovered basic quantum transmission. It was how they found the Talsoquian planet in the first place.”

“What was the distance?” I asked.

“It was something like… it was pretty small, like thirty or forty light-years. They knew there was an intelligent species from the chemical discharges.”

“How civilized were they?”

“Well, that’s the thing. They were moderate technology for sure, about the same as Earth’s Modern Age. But they were very particular about what technology they had. As far as the Andrometes could tell, they were restrained in their development and very conscious of the Talsoquian ecosystem, very much unlike Modern Earth. Their use of technology was strictly regulated and controlled by some social order or whatever.

“So, the Andrometes, they contacted this strange planet. And they were really expecting to hear back. Not right away, but eventually. Perhaps some prepared responses from their government or whatever. But what they heard, instead, was their own words repeated back to them.”

“So?” interrupted Lules. “We get quantum echoes all the time. Most of the receiving units’ functions are to sort out unique signals from a chaotic number of reflected signals.”

“No, they weren’t reflections,” said Trevor, leaning forward. “They weren’t echoes. These were more, like, rearranged versions of their own words. Like someone had taken the recorded signal and spliced it apart, copied pieces of it, et cetera.

“After researching their radio transmissions a little more, they discovered something really incredible — this species *did not talk*. They understood language, and they even had some, uh, I guess *vestigial* method of verbal communication, but they didn’t use it. They communicated primarily nonverbally, mostly I think through body language and heightened expressive awareness. But the Andrometes thought they got lucky and discovered a telepathic species on their first try.”

“Heh,” Lule muttered under her breath. Humanity still hadn’t come into contact with any such species, even after centuries of interstellar travel, and we weren’t even sure if such communication was possible for complex space-faring civilizations.

“Did they have a written language?” I asked.

“Well,” said Trevor, grinning widely, this being his specialty. “Sort of. They had something like a hieroglyph, but it wasn’t purely symbolic. It’s complicated. It was related to their facial expressions or pheromones or however they actually communicated. I don’t think the Andrometes were ever able to decipher it, they didn’t get the chance.”

“Was any other species able to?”

“Well, see, here’s the thing. The Andrometes contacted this planet long before anyone else did. So they got first contact. And what happened was… So, the Talsoquians sent a ton of these spliced-up messages back. The Andrometes were trying to communicate with them in their native language, and were helping them figure it out. They didn’t know much about the Talsoquians at first, until one day, they got a *peculiar* message back.”

He drew a dramatic breath.

“They finally got a recording of a Talsoquian *speaking*. They’d never had this before. They only had reconstituted audio clips of their own voices. But they finally got an original recording, of a Talsoquian, using its mouth, which no Talsoquian had used in *thousands of years*, apparently, to say hello. And — here’s the kicker — they said hello *in the Andrometes’ language*.”

Trevor leaned back and smiled, expecting a reaction. Lule and I were unimpressed. Lule more so. She continued to look at Trevor with as much skepticism as ever.

“So the Andrometes were impressed. It had only been maybe sixty days since first contact, and some top-brass Talsoquian had figured out not only how to communicate in the Andromete language, but how to speak. A *huge* evolutionary leap forward for them, right? But what I wanted to point out with this legend or whatever — something that one Andromete told me was really the core of the story — was that the Talsoquians’ verbalization spread like a fucking plague. Once people got wind of the concept of *speaking*, of *talking*, it became *so much easier* than their old way of communicating. Every Talsoquian on the planet quickly caught wind of speaking. It changed *everything*.”

He stopped, his face beaming with excitement, and gulped down his drink, his mouth dry and hot. I had rarely seen him radiate like this, not even at great social gatherings. Lule was still doubtful but utterly transfixed, staring at his mouth as if trying to guess the next words that might escape his throat.

“Their whole society changed. Their relationships changed. People started becoming more interconnected, more Andromete even. They started organizing their culture around what the Andrometes thought valuable, based on their vocabulary. They started thinking of themselves as discrete individuals to fit the Andromete language. Because of their old manner of speaking, they originally weren’t so individualistic, so egotistical. But the Andromete language, like ours, or like most sophisticated languages, have very definite “I” concepts, right? Self and other. Plus, at the time, Andromeda was starkly similar to Modern-era Earth, right? You see where this is going.”

“They turned into Andromeda,” offered Lule.

“*Close*,” said Trevor. “They became a weird, ahistorical version. They forgot almost everything about how to live in their old ways. They lost almost all their original, balanced, you know, eco-friendly attitudes. They became very capitalistic, very violent, believe it or not! Once a peaceful planet, Talsoq rapidly turned into all against all.

“And the Andrometes were watching this *the whole time*. And they couldn’t really do anything about it. Talsoq was changing so rapidly based on a little sliver of information, and they were *demanding* contact. And Andromeda was just giving it to them. They were so excited to have a sort of neighbor, they didn’t even realize that they were infecting another planet.”

“Sorry,” I interjected. “You’ve been alluding to it this whole time, but— you’re talking about language like it’s some sort of virus.”

“Of course I am!” said Trevor. “It is! Well, it’s like a virus of the mind. You ever recall learning a new word, some word that’s utterly useless? Something like *colleague*, which is only used in very specific contexts, referring to a very specific thing, and not really used anymore. And you forget it right away because you never use it. But then someone invents some slang, right, and it catches on like wildfire. Eventually a lot of slang becomes part of the vernacular. Did you know that *fucking* used to be one of the worst swear words in English? Now not even my great-grandmother would pale at it.

“The English language, and the Andromete language, which are very similar, they're like whole bodies riddled with these viruses. Some viruses are more effective than others, and repopulate. And some die. And some complex systems of viruses kill their host. Well, that Andromete system took over the Talsoquian host. And because the language is a reflection of an era, the Talsoquians adopted the Andromete culture too. They got there *very quickly*, and with no social safeguards. And so one day, like thirty years later, the Andrometes tuned into the planet, and found that they had completely disappeared.”

“What?” I said.

“They had wiped themselves out,” said Trevor. “All of the cultural tensions, the dangerous technology, the instability, had caused the Talsoquians to bring about global armageddon. See, speech was more efficient communication, but it was also extremely risky. They weren’t so used to the language, and so different people picked up different contexts of the same words and phrases. One of those became a fatal declaration of war, and with their new technology, they destroyed the planet.”

“Crazy,” said Lule. “But I still have a hard time picturing how radically a society can change based on that.”

“It’s pretty impressive.” Trevor leaned back, eyes drifting up to space. “Makes you think how we survived all this time, in our own period.”

“Well, we certainly haven’t had a monoculture throughout most of our history,” I offered. “Up until very very recently. Were the Andrometes that way when they contacted the Talsoquians?”

Trevor pondered. “Come to think of it, probably not. I think they were still pretty feudal in a de facto way. Could be there was one province that dominated—”

Suddenly his eyes gleamed. “*Or*,” he started, a beaming smile stretching back across his face, “there was some unconscious ill intent in the Andromete’s language. Some conquering or warlike nature in their language perhaps, that only modern civilization sublimated. But the Talsoquians, without those social buffers…”

“No way,” I said. “Remember Hanlon’s Law?”

“I'd say that only applies to *human* nature,” replied Trevor. “The Andrometes are a little more… I suppose… *complicated*, socially, than humans.”

“More complicated than humans!” laughed Lule, knowing that humans were relatively predictable amongst the interstellar pantheon. “Impressive. But so you’re saying that the language’s subtext was lost completely on the alien species.”

“Yeah, sarcasm, idiom, all that stuff can be easily overlooked in naive translations,” said Trevor confidently. “If your only contact is light-years away, it’s probably difficult to understand the nuance that comes with total immersion in a language. You’re probably right.” He leaned back in his chair, curling his tongue around his teeth in thought. “You’re probably right. Regardless, this destruction of an entire alien civilization was so traumatic to Andromeda, as a society, they unified around this disaster so strongly that their entire society was, in turn, reorganized *away* from the kind of philosophies that had brought destruction onto their only known neighbors in the universe. On the cusp of space exploration and extraterrestrial contact, what would happen if they accidentally transformed other planets as harshly as this first one? They would be seen as conquerors, and something about that didn’t set quite right with them. They may have been complex and warlike at the time, but it affected them on a deep level. It’s as if they were psychologically engaged in that ecosystem that was thrown off balance by the Talsoquian’s apocalypse.”

Lule laughed. “Come on, Trevor. *Now* you’ve lost me.”

“Really!” said Trevor. “Remember, this isn’t a tale about people. This is about Andrometes. They’re a little more sensitive, if dull. Fuck, can you imagine if *humans* had discovered and infected this planet in our modern era! They wouldn’t have lasted a year, let alone thirty!”
